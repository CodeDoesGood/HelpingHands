## Description
Canada has been a welcoming place for refugees. However, there is no system for connecting donor Canadians with refugees who needs help for things like furniture, jobs and services (nanny services, retail jobs, etc). 

Helping Hands is a mobile application to connect refugee claimants in Canada with Good Samaritans who have services, goods, and jobs to offer. In simple terms, Helping Hands will do the job of connecting donors to claimants.

## Primary Issue
Refugees who are seeking asylum, need help with respect to goods, services and jobs. Contacting Good Samaritans to obtain details of the items available for donation is very important in such situations. The hope is, using a specific mobile application designed for the purpose will be very simple and effective in connecting canadians and refugees for claiming goods.
