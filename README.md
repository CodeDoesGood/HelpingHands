# HelpingHands
Connecting newly landed refugees with free services, free items, and jobs they can apply for.

# Description
Canada has been a welcoming place for refugees. However, there is no system for connecting donor Canadians with refugees who needs help for things like furniture, jobs and services (nanny services, retail jobs, etc). 

Helping Hands is a mobile application to connect refugee claimants in Canada with Good Samaritans who have services, goods, and jobs to offer. In simple terms, Helping Hands will do the job of connecting donors to claimants.
